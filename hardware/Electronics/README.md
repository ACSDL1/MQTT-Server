# Electronics
Each module in the MQTT tower system is documented here with annotated images and wiring diagrams where necessary.

Draw.io files `.drawio` used to create the annotated images can be found in their respective module directories. These can be opened and edited using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). 
- If you are using VSCode, consider installing the [Draw.io Integration extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) for easier access.

This includes details on the hardware components used, their configurations, and any custom modifications made to suit the project's requirements.

The hardware for housing these electronics are found in the [CAD_models](CAD_models) directory.
